# Buried Treasure Fix
This datapack fixes the bug in Minecraft Java 1.19.x where opening a chest that has a buried treasure map inside lags out the game / server by replacing the buried treasure map with a barrel holding the contents of the buried treasure chest.

## NOTE:
This datapack does not change the chance of finding a buried treasure map, so you will end up with more loot than you normally would because multiple maps can point to the same buried treasure chest. If you want a more balanced approach you can edit the weights in the loot tables to make the barrels more rare.
